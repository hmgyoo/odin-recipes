# odin-recipes

## Introduction

This will be a basic recipes website as a practice and part of the The Odin Project Curriculum.

### What does this sample website do?

It starts with a landing page where the there are two recipes, (1) Mac 'n Cheese and (2) Hidden Veggie Meatloaf recipes that the user can navigate to.

Upon reaching the respective recipes pages, there will be an image of the recipe, a short yet elaborate description of the recipe, what are the ingredients needed, and what are the steps to take when making the recipe.

This is a brutalist website. Proceed with caution.
